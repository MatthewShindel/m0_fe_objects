# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

I feel pretty good with my work so far. I think that I have had some challenges with some of the work presented to me, and while I'm still practicing the material, I think im getting better at remembering each of the methods I use in my programming. I think that so far I've had productive struggle, where I'm not just stuck on a problem, moreso thinking about how to solve a particular issue i've come across. 

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

Most of the time, I've been working for about 45 minutes at a time, then taking a 10 minute break to cool down. However in this last lesson I've just did the whole thing in one sitting with no breaks, since I was in the zone. The main thing that I think will be a challenge going forward is making sure that I don't spend too long working in one long session, otherwise I might burn myself out to early in the day.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

In this exercise, I didn't know you could have arrays in objects, so that was somethign new I've learned. I'm also still practicing how to call the keys and values using Object.keys() and Object.values() respectively, as well as all the other methods that are inside of te Object class. I also think that I was intimidated by the last problem in the objects.js file, but I broke it down into more manageable parts, which made it easier to do.
